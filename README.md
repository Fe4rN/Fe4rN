## 🧑‍💻Biography
Since I was a little kid I was fascinated by technology. I used to stay up late to watch my brother install drivers on our home computer so I could play Minecraft and I was amazed by the things a computer could do. Not long after I got access to my first laptop and almost immediately started to tinker with it, developing a love for game development. Some years later I began researching into components and eventually managed to save up for my own PC. From there, I started full-fledged game development and that's where I'm currently at.
